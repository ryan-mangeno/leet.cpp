### STL Containers & Complexity

**Your Task**
Demonstrate your knowledge of C++ STL containers (Map vs Unordered Map, Vector, etc) by returning the correct **Big-O Complexity** strings.

**Format:**
Return strings like `"O(1)"`, `"O(n)"`, `"O(log n)"`, etc.

**Questions:**
1. What is the average time complexity to **insert** into a `std::vector` at the **end**?
2. What is the time complexity to **search** by key in a `std::map` (Red-Black Tree)?
3. What is the average time complexity to **search** by key in a `std::unordered_map` (Hash Map)?
4. What happens when a `std::vector` grows? (Return "reallocation")
