# C++ Practice Problems

A collection of C++ programming challenges with test harnesses.

## Structure

Each problem is in its own directory under `problems/` and contains:

- `prompt.md` - Problem description
- `starter.h` - Starting template code
- `test_harness.cpp` - Automated tests
- `submission.h` - Your solution (where applicable)

Problems will be added on an ongoing basis ...

## Usage

1. Read the `prompt.md` for the problem you want to solve
2. Implement your solution in `starter.h` or `submission.h`
3. Compile and run the test harness to verify your solution

## Files

- `app.py` - Main application runner
- `README.py` - Project documentation script
